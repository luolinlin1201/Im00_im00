During my internship as a Business Operations Assistant in the Finance Department from February to June 2023, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a dynamic role that involved a range of responsibilities crucial to the departmentâ€™s functioning. This experience not only provided me with valuable insights into corporate finance but also allowed me to apply my skills in a practical setting.

One of the core aspects of my role was ensuring compliance by meticulously checking agreements and orders with clients. This involved careful attention to detail and a thorough understanding of contractual obligations. By verifying the accuracy and completeness of these documents, I contributed to maintaining the integrity of our client relationships and operations.

Additionally, I served as a Sales Backup, where I supported the sales team by preparing presentation slides, communicating directly with clients, and organizing critical data in the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system. This multifaceted responsibility required effective communication skills and the ability to manage information efficiently. By doing so, I helped ensure that all stakeholders were well-informed and that the sales process remained streamlined and effective.

A significant part of my role also involved data analysis and reporting. Using Excel, I created detailed weekly business performance reports utilizing tools such as VLOOKUP, pivot tables, and various formulas. These reports were based on datasets containing over 10,000 rows of data, highlighting key metrics and trends. This analytical work not only sharpened my proficiency in Excel but also enabled me to provide actionable insights to the finance team, aiding in strategic decision-making processes.

Moreover, I actively contributed to enhancing operational efficiency within the department. By identifying areas for improvement and suggesting process optimizations, I helped streamline workflows and reduce redundancy, ultimately contributing to overall productivity.

Reflecting on my internship experience, I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked in a role that allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in a real-world context. The hands-on experience I gained in ensuring compliance, supporting sales activities, and conducting data analysis has been invaluable. It has reinforced my passion for finance and operations, providing a solid foundation for my future career aspirations.

In conclusion, my internship as a Business Operations Assistant in the Finance Department was a fulfilling and educational experience. It equipped me with practical skills, deepened my understanding of corporate finance operations, and confirmed my interest in pursuing a career in this field. I am excited to build upon this foundation as I continue to grow both personally and professionally in the world of business operations.
