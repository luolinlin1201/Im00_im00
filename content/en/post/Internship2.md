## Driving Sales Excellence and Market Understanding

One of the pivotal roles I undertook was as an Internal Sales representative, where I immersed myself in understanding market needs deeply. Collaborating closely with the category leader, we aimed to achieve a €50 million sales target for 2023. This involved strategic coordination of supply chains, meticulous market analysis, and proactive engagement with stakeholders to ensure alignment and timely execution.

## Strategic Development and Roadmapping

A major highlight of my internship was the opportunity to develop comprehensive strategies, roadmaps, and marketing toolkits for low-end products. This endeavor required a blend of analytical skills, market research insights, and creative thinking to effectively position our offerings and capture market opportunities.

## Harnessing Data for Informed Decision-Making

Data analysis played a crucial role throughout my internship. I utilized SAP to analyze and visualize KPI and sales data, transforming complex datasets into concise, actionable insights. This involved leveraging Excel and Power BI to create insightful presentations that informed strategic discussions and supported decision-making processes within the team.

## Driving Innovation: AI Voice Project

One of the most exciting projects I spearheaded was the AI voice project at Versuni. Tasked with delivering voice alerts in over 30 languages within a tight timeline of 4 months, I collaborated independently with external agencies and markets. This project not only required meticulous project management skills but also highlighted the importance of effective stakeholder communication and agile problem-solving in a dynamic environment.

## User Experience Transformation: Crisis Management

During the internship, I faced a critical challenge in improving the Philips HomeRun App's user experience. Within a span of 4 months, I led efforts to boost the app's rating from 1.3 to an impressive 4.4. This involved conducting extensive research through face-to-face interviews, analyzing user reviews and competitor benchmarks, and working closely with R&D to swiftly address critical issues. Introducing a rating pop-up mechanism significantly increased user feedback, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement and user-centric design.

The hands-on projects and responsibilities equipped me with invaluable skills and insights that will undoubtedly shape my future career aspirations in the tech and consumer electronics industry.

In conclusion, my internship at Versuni was a remarkable chapter in my professional development, filled with achievements, challenges, and the satisfaction of contributing to meaningful projects.
