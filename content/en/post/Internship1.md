During the period from February to June 2023, I worked as a Business Operations Assistant in the Finance Department at Hanshow. <!--more--> This experience provided me with the opportunity to act as a bridge between departments, overseeing crucial responsibilities essential to the company's operations. By participating in this role, I not only deepened my understanding of corporate finance but also had the chance to interact with various departments, gaining insights into their respective roles and honing my skills in cross-departmental coordination.

As a Business Operations Assistant, one of my primary responsibilities was data analysis and reporting. Using Excel, I created detailed weekly business performance reports utilizing VLOOKUP, pivot tables, and various formulas. These reports focused primarily on accounts receivable, based on a dataset containing over 10,000 rows of data, highlighting key metrics and trends. Through this analytical work, I not only enhanced my Excel proficiency but also provided actionable insights to the finance team, facilitating strategic decision-making processes and sharpening my attention to detail.

Another significant aspect of my role involved ensuring compliance through meticulous review of client agreements and orders. This required attention to detail and a deep understanding of contractual obligations. By verifying the accuracy and completeness of these documents through phone calls and emails with clients, I contributed to maintaining the integrity of our client relationships. This experience taught me how to effectively manage client relationships and efficiently gather necessary information in a prompt and courteous manner.

Furthermore, I was responsible for inputting crucial data into the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to maintain data accuracy and coordinate between supply chain, sales, and client services to ensure timely deliveries.

I also assisted in preparing sales presentations and directly communicating with clients, requiring effective communication skills and efficient management of information. Through these efforts, I ensured that all stakeholders received comprehensive information and that the sales process remained efficient and smooth.

Additionally, I actively contributed to enhancing departmental operational efficiency by identifying areas for improvement and proposing process optimization suggestions. For example, during a review of contracts, I identified a need for a simple document to store key contract information. Upon discussion with my manager, who fully supported the idea, I spent a week reviewing over 30 contracts totaling more than 100 pages, recorded key information in an Excel spreadsheet, identified unclear terms in existing contracts, discussed them with the legal department to avoid future disputes. Finally, I uploaded this document to the team's shared documents, ensuring accessibility and significantly enhancing the efficiency of the sales, finance, and legal departments.

Reflecting on my internship experience, I am grateful for the opportunity to apply academic knowledge in a role that allowed me to work in a real-world environment. The practical experience I gained in ensuring compliance, supporting sales activities, and conducting data analysis was invaluable. It deepened my understanding of corporate financial operations and affirmed my affinity for numbers, client support, and excellent cross-departmental coordination skills, leading me to choose Business Analytics and Data Science as my minor.

In summary, my internship as a Business Operations Assistant in the Finance Department at Hanshow was enriching and highly educational. It equipped me with practical skills, deepened my understanding of corporate financial operations, and confirmed my strengths and suitable career path.
