From 2021 to 2024, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Communication Studies and a minor in Business Analytics and Data Science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. During my three years at university, I worked full-time for a year and a half. For more details about my work experience, please refer to 'xxx'.

## 2021-2023
During the first two years of my studies in Communication Studies, I mainly learned how information dissemination in various fields and elements like color packaging influence people's subconscious, thereby affecting their decisions and perceptions. Additionally, I became proficient in using SPSS for data cleaning, descriptive statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing through t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to determine the significance of relationships and differences between data. Furthermore, each course honed my ability to explain complex research findings clearly to individuals without related knowledge, enhancing my critical thinking skills.

## Minor: Business Analytics and Data Science (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, September 2023 - February 2024)
Through this minor, I gained practical experience in machine learning and data analysis. Before this, I had not systematically learned Python, and balancing this with full-time work was a significant challenge. I recall at the beginning of the course, the professor asked about our backgroundsâ€”70% of the students came from AI or data science fields, and I was the only one from social sciences with no Python experience. Despite this, I successfully completed the course, which had a pass rate of only 50%.

From these courses, I learned the following:

1. Introduction to Data Science:
Acquired fundamental concepts and processes of data science, including data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization.
Learned to use programming languages like Python for data analysis and model building.
Gained familiarity with common data science tools and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

2. Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation:
Studied the importance of technology and innovation in business strategy.
Mastered basic theories and practices of technology management and innovation management.
Understood how to enhance a company's competitiveness through innovation strategies, and manage technological changes and innovation processes.

3. Information Retrieval:
Learned fundamental concepts and techniques of information retrieval, including how search engines work.
Studied key techniques in information retrieval like indexing, searching, ranking, and evaluation.
Explored the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning in information retrieval.

4. Data Structures and Algorithms for CS:
Acquired knowledge of common data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs) and their operations.
Learned basic algorithms (such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms) and their complexity analysis.
Developed skills to design efficient algorithms to solve practical problems and optimize code performance.

5. Data Wrangling:
Gained skills in data cleaning, integration, and transformation techniques and tools.
Learned methods to handle structured and unstructured data, including dealing with missing values and data format conversions.
Understood how to prepare and organize data for subsequent analysis and modeling.

Through these courses, I not only gained theoretical knowledge in data science and technology management but also acquired practical skills. This enables me to perform effective data analysis, information retrieval, and data processing, providing a solid foundation for solving real-world problems.

## Thesis
In June 2024, I completed my thesis titled "The Myth of Color: How Low-Saturated Packaging Can Entice You to Make a Purchase?" Please click on "Education & Work" at the bottom to read the article titled "Thesis (Marketing): The Impact of Pale Packaging on Soda Choices"
