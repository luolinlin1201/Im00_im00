Hi, my name is Linlin Luo. I moved to Amsterdam three years ago. It was an unexpected decision, much like my choice to take a data science minor at VU. Now, as I stand at the turning point of my life—graduation—I feel a strong desire to use what I've learned at university to share my story. Maybe it will inspire you too.

## 2002 - 2020, Shantou, China

I grew up in a seaside city near the equator, a place that is sunny year-round and incredibly beautiful. When COVID-19 broke out, it was my last year of high school. Thanks to my great analytical abilities, I decided to study Biology.

## 2021, Harbin, China

I went to the northernmost part of China to study. After the first semester of Biology, I realized that words are more powerful than medicines. Words influence people profoundly. That's why I decided to switch to Communication Science.

## 2021-2024, Amsterdam, Netherlands

To be honest, it was very difficult to adapt to a new environment and education system.

## 2024 - , ?

Recently, I sat down to reflect and found that life is full of coincidences and surprises. That’s what makes it so wonderful. A coin has two sides, and sometimes, failure is just a push towards a better-suited path. I am ready for my next journey!
