Hey, I am Linlin Luo from China. Three years ago, I moved to Amsterdam for my studies. One day, I came across a senior software engineer showcasing his personal website on social media. Despite having no prior experience with HTML, I decided to give it a try! Taking on challenging tasks gives me a sense of accomplishment. I believe life is an adventure, and the joy lies in tackling challenges and trying new things. Graduating in July 2024 marks an important turning point for me, and I aim to summarize my student journey through creating this website.

This realization led me to pursue Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam, hoping to contribute to making the world a better place.
